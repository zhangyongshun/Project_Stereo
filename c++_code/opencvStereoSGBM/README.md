**sgm_without_cuda.cpp**
  
  It is a original edition of SGM algorithm, which runs under CPU, because I think it's easy to debug under CPU.
  
  It has been finished yet, but most functions have been tested, which means a frame and other little work need to be done later.
  
  INPUT: left images and right images
  
  OUTPUT: disparity images
